# [ARAD: A Recipe A Day](https://a-recipe-a-day.herokuapp.com/)
## Project Proposal
 
### Project Abstract
ARAD is a web application that diversify the user's cooking skills and dishes. The website will display a new, randomly selected food recipe everyday. The user is challenged to follow the recipe, it could be a recipe the user hasn't made before. For example, many people who do stove-top cooking have not dabbled in baking; the recipe of the day could change that. The user can then upload photos of their creations onto the ARAD database along with comments on how the recipe turned out, creating their own Food Journal.
 
### Audience
Our target audience is people who are interested in recreational cooking. ARAD is specifically aimed at those who are comfortable with basic cooking techniques (preparing foods, able to use a stove, knife, etc.) and want to expand their cooking spectrum, while having fun doing it. Due to the random nature of our recipe selection, it is less accommodating for users with no previous cooking experience.
 
### Competitive Analysis
There is only one website with an idea similar to ours, called Recipe Roulette (found at reciperoulette.tv). However, it is quite simple and sparse. ARAD differs in these key ways:
 
1) ARAD supports the Food Journal feature. The Food Journal is meant to incentivize daily completion of the challenge.
 
2) ARAD does not allow rerolls, as seen on Recipe Roulette. One of our goal is for users to venture out of their comfort zone, and rerolling the recipe accomplishes the opposite.
 
### User Interface Requirements
On the main page, a picture of the food of the day is shown, along with its recipe. Below that is the "Upload" button, which allows the user to upload a photo to their Food Journal, with comments about the resulting dish. The main subpage is the Food Journal, displaying the userâ€™s uploaded images, and located in the top right are links to other subpages.

# ARAD: A Recipe A Day
## Project Proposal
 
### Project Abstract
ARAD is a web application whose purpose is to diversify the user's cooking skills and dishes. It is intended to be used as a homepage. Every day, the website will display a new, randomly selected food recipe. The user is challenged to follow the recipe, even if it is something the user hasn't made before. For example, many people who do stove-top cooking have not dabbled in baking; the recipe of the day could change that. The user can then upload photos of their creations onto the ARAD database along with short comments on how the day's recipe turned out, effectively creating their own Food Journal. The user will (hopefully) be able to customize their Food Journal as well.
 
### Customer
Our target audience is people who are interested in recreational cooking. ARAD is specifically aimed at those who are comfortable with basic cooking techniques (preparing foods, able to use a stove, knife, etc.) and want to broaden their cooking spectrum, having fun while doing it. Due to the random nature of our recipe selection, it is less accommodating for complete beginners.
 
### Competitive Analysis
As far as we've seen, there is only one website with an idea similar to ours, called Recipe Roulette (found at reciperoulette.tv). However, it is quite simple and sparse. ARAD differs in these key ways:
 
1) ARAD supports the Food Journal feature. The Food Journal is meant to incentivize daily completion of the challenge, as it gives users a level of personalization.
 
2) ARAD does not allow rerolls, as seen on Recipe Roulette. One of our hopes is to take users away from their comfort zone, and rerolling the recipe accomplishes the opposite.
 
3) ARAD has different customization options. Recipe Roulette has three options the user can select: cuisine, main ingredient, dietary requirements. Out of principle, ARAD would not support the first two options. Furthermore, due to the lack of rerolls, the daily recipes must  contain ingredients that the user is tolerant towards (think allergies, strong food preferences). The ingredients must also be available to the user that given day, which should be specified in advance. Such options will be accessible in the user's profile.
 
### User Interface Requirements
On the main page, a picture of the food of the day is shown, along with its recipe. On either side of the picture are the “Redo” and “Upload” buttons. Redo allows the user to repeat the recipe the following day if they fail the recipe, and Upload allows the user to upload a photo to their Food Journal, along with comments about your resulting dish. In the top right are links to subpages. The main subpage is the Food Journal, which displays the user’s uploaded images. Clicking on an image will pull up the comments attached to the image.

# [ARAD: A Recipe A Day](https://a-recipe-a-day.herokuapp.com/)
## Project Proposal
 
### Project Abstract
ARAD is a web application whose purpose is to diversify the user's cooking skills and dishes. Every day, the website will display a new, randomly selected food recipe. The user is challenged to follow the recipe, even if it is something the user hasn't made before. For example, many people who do stove-top cooking have not dabbled in baking; the recipe of the day could change that. The user can then upload photos of their creations onto the ARAD database along with short comments on how the day's recipe turned out, effectively creating their own Food Journal.
 
### Customer
Our target audience is people who are interested in recreational cooking. ARAD is specifically aimed at those who are comfortable with basic cooking techniques (preparing foods, able to use a stove, knife, etc.) and want to broaden their cooking spectrum, having fun while doing it. Due to the random nature of our recipe selection, it is less accommodating for complete beginners.
 
### Competitive Analysis
As far as we've seen, there is only one website with an idea similar to ours, called Recipe Roulette (found at reciperoulette.tv). However, it is quite simple and sparse. ARAD differs in these key ways:
 
1) ARAD supports the Food Journal feature. The Food Journal is meant to incentivize daily completion of the challenge.
 
2) ARAD does not allow rerolls, as seen on Recipe Roulette. One of our hopes is to take users away from their comfort zone, and rerolling the recipe accomplishes the opposite.
 
### User Interface Requirements
On the main page, a picture of the food of the day is shown, along with its recipe. Below that is the "Upload" button, which allows the user to upload a photo to their Food Journal, along with comments about the resulting dish. In the top right are links to subpages. The main subpage is the Food Journal, which displays the userâ€™s uploaded images. The other subpage is Other Journals, which allows users to access other users' Journals.
